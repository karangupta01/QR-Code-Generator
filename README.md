This QR Code Generator is a simple and efficient project built with Node.js, Express, Inquirer, QR-Image, and JavaScript, using the File System (fs) module.
It allows users to easily generate QR codes by entering a URL or text through a command-line interface powered by Inquirer.
The project takes the user input and creates a QR code image using the QR-Image library, saving it as a PNG file on the local system.
Itâ€™s a great example of combining backend technologies to create practical tools and demonstrates the power of Node.js for handling user input and file creation.
